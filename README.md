<ins> # Shoe Inventory System </ins>
This shoe inventory system has been written in Python. 
The inventory system allows the user ro read data from a text file, that data is stored in a variable within the programme and then used throughout. The user is then able to capture new shoes, view all the items in stock, search for a specific product using the product code, view and restock the shoe with the lowest count, view the shoe with the highest count and mark it on sale, as well as calculate the total value of a specific shoe in stock.
